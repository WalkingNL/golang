### go

#### strings

    a string is in effect a read-only slice of bytes

    
    
#### arrays

    Arrays are not often seen in Go programs because the size of an array is part of its type
**var buffer [256]bytes** and **var buffer [512]bytes** are distinct. 


#### slices


 ---
    A slice is not an array. A slice describes a piece of an array
